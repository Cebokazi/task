                 <p>The Castle of Good Hope in 1680 was used to announce the time, as well as warning citizens in case of danger, since it could be heard 10 kilometres away.</p> 
                It was also rung to summon residents and soldiers when important announcements needed to be made.</p>

              <p>During the Second Boer War (1899â€“1902), part of the castle was used as a prison, and the former cells remain to this day.</p> 
              <p>The Castle acted as local headquarters for the South African Army in the Western Cape, and today houses the Castle Military Museum and ceremonial facilities for the traditional Cape Regiments.</p>
              <p>This website is based on virtual tour.</p>
              <br>
              <p>After a lockdown lot of travelling people wanted to go visit the Castle of Good Hope Museum but because of the regulations and the rules it's not that easy for them to go there.</p>
              <p>We decided on creating this virtual tour to make their life easy for whorever will want to visit the castle of good hope.</p>
              <p>We even thought that some people hate standing in ques and doing all the covid rules, so to keep the business running for the Museum we came up with this idea.</p>
              <p>In this virtual tour you'll find almost everything you were going to see at the museum.</p>
              <p>We really saw a need of doing this virtual because most of the people aren't able to go there as usually they did so we making it easy instead of going there waiting for the number to decrease.</p>
